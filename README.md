# Krita Separate Brush and Eraser
Adds hotkeys that you can use to activate brush and eraser as if they're separate tools. You can find them in the shortcuts menu under Scripts > Separate Brush and Eraser. To make the brush and eraser track size and opacity separately as well, go to the brush settings and untick 'Eraser switch size' and 'Eraser switch opacity' on the bottom left of the window.

**Input adapter library taken from shortcuts composer**
